A green-orange color scheme. 

Heliotrope (a.k.a. bloodstone) is a mineral that is a dark chalcedony green with orange-red streaks. 

As I do most of my coding in Haskell, the colors for syntax elements has been chosen with their prevalence in mind: functions in orange, green for types and then different shades of each for the rest.
